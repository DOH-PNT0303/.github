name: Setup debugger
description: >-
  Sets up an interactive debugger for a job, with SSH access to the current
  runner machine over a Tailscale network.

  Authentication uses the public SSH keys associated with GitHub users.  By
  default, the users who triggered the initial and current workflow runs are
  allowed.

inputs:
  tailscale-auth-key:
    description: >-
      Tailscale auth key (i.e. from the admin panel); highly recommended to be
      ephemeral! Otherwise a runner will stick around and your Tailscale
      machine limit will be quickly reached.
