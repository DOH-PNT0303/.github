name: Setup SSH
description: >-
  Sets up SSH access to the current runner machine over a Tailscale network.

  Authentication uses the public SSH keys associated with GitHub users.  By
  default, the users who triggered the initial and current workflow runs are
  allowed.

inputs:
  tailscale-auth-key:
    description: >-
      Tailscale auth key (i.e. from the admin panel); highly recommended to be
      ephemeral! Otherwise a runner will stick around and your Tailscale
      machine limit will be quickly reached.
    required: true

  allowed-users:
    description: >-
      Comma-separated list of GitHub usernames who are allowed access via their
      public SSH keys.
    required: false
    default: "${{ github.triggering_actor }},${{ github.actor }}"

  wait-for-continue:
    description: >-
      Wait for a ~/continue file to appear before returning to the calling
      workflow.
    required: false
    default: false
