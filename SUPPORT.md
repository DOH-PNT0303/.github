# Help and Getting Started 

If you need help with Nextstrain or want to talk about how to get started using
it with your own data, please visit [our community discussion
forum][discussion].  The [welcome page][welcome] there is a good place to
start.

Weâ€™re very interested to help public health and academic groups run Nextstrain
analyses and share them (publicly or privately). The goal of the discussion
forum is to connect the community with each other and the core Nextstrain team
in order to share information and ideas and offer help. We can all learn
together as part of a larger community of practice.
